# Hi, I'm Carlos!
All-rounder software engineer based in Valencia, Spain

* Right now I work at Plantix as a backend engineer (REST, Python, Django, Flask, Postgres, MongoDB, Terraform)
* From 2016 to 2020, I designed libraries and services in Python, and wrote software in C for an embedded platform
* Before that, I wrote software for a medium-scale distributed system (Java and C++)
* I am currently learning Go and microservices architecture
* You can reach me at carlos.ghabrous@gmail.com, in French, English or Spanish
* Bringing up two children take a lot of time and effort, but I hope that I will be able to continue training for all-distance triathlons some day
