# Hi, I'm Carlos!
All-rounder software engineer based in Geneva, Switzerland

* During the last five years, I have designed libraries and services in Python, and written software in C for an embedded platform
* Before that, I wrote software for a medium-scale distributed system (Java and C++)
* I am currently learning Go and microservices architecture. I hope to get some time to dig into machine learning too. 
* You can reach me at carlos.ghabrous@gmail.com, in French, English or Spanish
* Bringing up two children take a lot of time and effort, but I hope that I will be able to continue training for all-distance triathlons some day
