# Hi, I'm Carlos!
All-rounder software engineer based in Valencia, Spain

* From October 2024, I have been working at Mitiga Solutions, startup in the climate/insurance tech space (Python, Argo, MongoDB, k8s, Azure)
* From 2022 to 2024, I worked at PEAT GmbH (Plantix) as a backend engineer (REST, Python, Django, Flask, Postgres, MongoDB, Terraform, AWS)
* From 2016 to 2020, I designed libraries and services in Python, wrote software in C for an embedded platform, and managed projects that involved different groups and 
around 10 engineers.
* Before that, I wrote software for a medium-scale distributed system (Java and C++)
* I am currently learning Go and microservices architecture
* You can reach me at carlos.ghabrous@gmail.com, in French, English or Spanish
* Bringing up two children take a lot of time and effort, but I hope that I will be able to continue training for all-distance triathlons some day
